# Hey, I'm Vince

I’m learning to build software that works well — reliable, clean, and understandable.  
Right now, my focus is on backend development: how data moves, how APIs are structured, and how to keep things simple without losing quality.

I’m not an expert yet. I’m building, breaking, fixing, and learning as I go — one project at a time.

---

## What I’m Exploring
- Backend development with Node.js and Express  
- Database design and API structure  
- Automation with Python  
- Flutter, occasionally, to bring ideas to life visually  

---

## Projects
Most of my repositories are learning projects or experiments that teach me something new.  
Each one reflects progress — not perfection — and that’s exactly what I’m aiming for.

---

## Tools I Use
JavaScript • Python • Dart  
Node.js • Express.js  
MongoDB • Firebase • Hive • PostgreSQL
Git • Postman • Cloudinary  

---

## Where I’m Headed
I want to understand backend systems deeply — how they scale, stay secure, and stay readable.  
The goal is simple: write code that makes sense, works well, and quietly gets the job done.
